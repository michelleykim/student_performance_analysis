# Code Of Conduct

## Goals
### What are our team goals for this project?
1. To go above and beyond with our knowledge and R skills
2. Take ownership and responsibility of the project- it is harder to feel as much responsibility for team projects, so we need to consciously reiterate ourselves
3. Work together as a group without any major conflicts- have a pleasant group project experience, making sure every voice is heard
### What do we want to accomplish?
1. Apply skills learned in DSCI 100- accurately read, manipulate, and analyze data
2. Solid reasoning and explanation throughout the project cycle, especially in the final report
3. Clear and professional writing that is hopefully similar to industry practices
4. Achieve a good mark 
### What skills do we want to develop or refine?
1. Refine skills related to R language
2. Analytical skills of data types
3. Further develop critical thinking skills
4. Applications to real-world situations

## Expectations
### What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
We expect each other to contribute equally and fairly to the project. Once started we will allot equal portions of the project to one another, ensuring equal workload amongst the group. Splitting the responsibilities also enforces accountability, which we all need to have for our work. 
We expect members to communicate with the rest of the group:

* In case we are unable to complete/need help with our task.
* When unexpected circumstances arise and we will be unable to attend a meeting or complete a task on-time.

We expect each group member to be responsible and actively engage and contribute to the project by attending scheduled meetings and completing tasks well before the deadline -- allowing time to edit and refine work.

## Policies & Procedures
### What rules can we agree to help us meet our goals and expectations?
1. If a member realizes they are unable to complete one of their tasks by the deadline, they will let the other group members know in advance of the deadline.
2. If a member is unable to complete their task, they will find another task to complete instead, so that the work is still shared equally.
3. If a team member has a question or an issue about the project, they will first try to find the answer on their own. If they are not able to solve the question after a reasonable time they should ask the rest of the group for help.

## Consequences
### How will we address non-performance regarding goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
1. Warning will be given out, and based on the severity of the actions.
2. If there are issues between group members, we will discuss them first as a group and attempt to solve the issue.
3. If issues persist after discussing between the team members, the group will meet with a TA to help solve the conflict as a group.

We are all university students and know our responsibilities, conflicts do arise, we will be understanding of each otherâ€™s circumstances so long as it does not become a habit.
